/* Chessboard Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using new line characters to separate 
lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a 
chessboard. Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # # 
# # # # 
 # # # # 
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works 
for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
